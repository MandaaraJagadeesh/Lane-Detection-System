# Lane Detection System

A computer vision application for detecting lane lines in images using advanced image processing techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV and other libraries to identify and highlight lane markings in images captured from road scenes.

## Features

- **Lane Detection**: Detects lane markings in images using image processing techniques.
- **Image Processing**: Applies filtering, edge detection, and region-of-interest (ROI) selection to enhance lane detection.
- **Visualization**: Highlights detected lanes on the original image for easy interpretation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip



## Project Structure

- `detect_lanes.py`: Main script for detecting lanes in images.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for image processing.
- `images/`: Directory containing sample images for testing.
- `output/`: Directory where processed images will be saved.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
